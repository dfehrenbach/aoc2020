# Day 1

> Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn’t quite adding up.\
> \
> Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.\
> \
> For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

```
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```

> In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 \* 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.\
> \
> Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

Due to the simplicity of **Day 1**, everyone’s solutions are sometimes creative and funky, like the solutions in [VIM](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/ge8nctl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [Bash](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/gea8skb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [Rockstar](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/ge8uwqi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (where this one, according to the author, sounds like a song from Rage Against the Machine; I agree!), and [Intcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/ge8rwqc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Along with some honest to goodness short-n-sweet-n-readable solutions like these in [Haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/ge8dv07?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/ge8d95j?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/ge8cu21?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [Ruby](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4e4lm/2020_day_1_solutions/ge8dg41?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
