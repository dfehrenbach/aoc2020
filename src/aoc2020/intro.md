The Advent of Code has officially started as of yesterday!

A reminder that it’s a series of puzzles that get incrementally more difficult and can be a good amount of fun to solve in the breaks, early mornings, evenings, etc. I highly encourage those of you who are interested to give it a shot and stretch some of your coding/problem-solving brain muscles. That said, even if you don’t participate, getting a chance to read through some of the leading community members’ solutions is a treat and can be a wonderful learning experience (I’d argue the “primary” learning experience for this event where writing your own is “tertiary” if only for context).

I’ll be slapping the previous day’s problem statement (everyone’s input is different), a link to the “day”, and a reddit/forum thread with cool solutions to read through. (I may even post highlights for solutions that I found interesting!)

Without further adieu:

> After saving Christmas five years in a row, you’ve decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.

> The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you’ll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.

> To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

> Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
